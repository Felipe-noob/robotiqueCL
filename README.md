Code for a line follower robot for an introductory course at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille

It's not perfect, sometimes it incorrectly detects curves. We did not have the time to correct these issues. This repo has been opened to showcase our coding habilities.

It uses several PID control parameters depending on its position. In order to keep the code organized, we have implemented a finite state machine.

The project is based on the depracated MakeBlock board MeMegaPi and uses the RGB Line Follower v1.0 to detect the line.
